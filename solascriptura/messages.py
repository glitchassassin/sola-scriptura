NO_MODULES_DETECTED="""
SolaScriptura did not find any modules in the default module directory (currently "{}").

You can run the Setup wizard with [F5] to try to download and install a few default Bible versions from the SWORD Project repositories. Or, you can download the zipped modules yourself and copy them to the module directory.

If you'd like to store your modules elsewhere, edit your ~/.solascriptura config file and set the [modules] default_path to your module directory. Be sure to use the full path to avoid unpredictable behavior!

SETUP="""
SolaScriptura can try to automatically download a few Bible versions from the SWORD Project repository to get you started.

You'll need an Internet connection and write access to the [modules] default_path defined in your ~/.solascriptura config file.

Proceed?
